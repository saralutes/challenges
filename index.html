    <h3 id="who">Who is Charlie?</h3>
    <p id="about-charlie">Charlie is a 7 year old Bichon Frise mix who loves to play and snuggle with people. He is the perfect handsome companion for all of your adventures - big enough to hike, run, and play but small enough to sit on your lap or cuddle on the couch. Bichons have been the companions of European nobles since the 13th century and even Cleopatra was fond of "little white dogs". Bichons often accompanied royalty, in the late 16th century Henry III of France loved the breed so much that he always had at least one of his Bichon's with him at all times.

        <br>
        <br>Charlie's personality is 100% Bichon - he loves being a companion! He isn't the smartest dog but he tries hard and is a happy little fellow. He knows the following commands: sit, stay, lay down, come, dance, high five, and fist bump. He became a part of our family when he decided to take a nap on our porch on a lovely fall day. He didn't have any tags or collar. We took him to animal control and he did not have a micro-chip. After a 10 day stay with animal control Charlie was neutered, vaccinated, wormed, and adopted by us when no other family claimed him.</p>
