Please pay careful attention to all sections but especially the section on <a href="#Emotional_Care">emotional care</a> as you do not want Charlie to become bored, sad, or angry (this may lead to both toilet paper and underwear being eaten).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Charlie is a Bichon mix with a 100% Bichon personality</li>

    <p>Charlie enjoys spending a large portion of his day napping. It is important that each room humans spend a large amount of time in has a cuddly sleeping space for Charlie. This could be a dog bed or snuggly blanket on a chair, couch, etc. Charlie may scratch, move, tear, etc. the sleeping materials so it is important that you select durable materials or materials you do not mind replacing.</p>
    <p>At night, Charlie will want to sleep as close to his humans as you will allow. A dog bed outside your bedroom door or a comfy space under your bed are perfect spots! Charlie is afraid of fireworks and loud, firework like, noises. If these are going on at night you will need to let Charlie sleep in the same room as you to avoid barking, whining, and/or scratching at your door in the nighttime.</p>

  <article>
    <p>Charlie HATES being groomed. He would much prefer to be a stinky dirt-grub so it is your job as his human to maintain a certain level of Charlie cleanliness. He will whine, cry, squirm, and try to escape any cleaning rituals so be prepared to harden your heart against his pleas in order to keep him clean and healthy. It is HIGHLY recommended that you pay a professional to groom your Charlie.</p>
    <p>The best way to cut his nails and hair is to either pay a professional or use an elevated grooming table to secure him during the grooming process. You will also need a lot of paitence if you decide to groom him yourself. Bathing is best done in a large sink or tub with a spray hose. Charlie does not have sensitive skin but a whitening shampoo for dogs or an all natural dog shampoo are recommended.</p>
    <h3>Finally, be sure to give many many treatos upon completion of the grooming!</h3>

  <article>
    <p>Charlie is a lazy doggo and does require a large amount of exercise - 2 short walks and 1 long walk a day are sufficient. However, he is an energetic dog and will be up for as many walkies, ball fetch sessions, runs, and games of chase the hippo as you would like to engage in each day.</P>

    <p>Charlie is a sensitive doggo who loves his people more than any other thing in the entire world. Given this nature, it is essential that you spend time each day taking him for walks, talking to him, letting him watch you pee, and cuddling on the couch. Neglecting his emotional care can lead to your Charlie refusing to eat, puking on the floor, chewing toilet paper and tissues, and eating underwear or socks.</p>

    <p>If you find yourself with a Charlie that is misbehaving (eating underwear, chewing toilet paper, etc.) refer to the following list:
      <ul>
        <li>Pick up the offending item</li>
        <li>Show the item to Charlie</li>
        <li>Say "Bad Dog" in a mean voice (note, this will make your Charlie very sad and he will try to hide)</li>
        <li>Repeat "Bad Dog" until Charlie is repentent<li>
        <li>Refer to the <a href="#Emotional_Care">Emotional Care</a>section to comfort your Charlie and remind him that he is a good pupper who love</li>
        <li>Make sure you have not neglected the emotional care of your Charlie</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>If your Charlie has puked on the floor refer to the following list:
      <ul>
        <li>Find out if your Charlie has eaten his food. Not eating is the number 1 cause of Charlie puking.</li>
        <li>Encourage your Charlie to eat by standing in the same room as his dish or mixing a small amount of a delicous treat such as blueberries, bananas, or peanut butter in with his dog food.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
<p>If all else fails, you can factory reset your Charlie using the following codes:</p>
<div class="grid-container" id="code">
  <div class="grid-item"><code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } greetMe("World");</code>
<br>
<br>
<code>x = 5; y = 6; z = x + y; </code>
<br>
<code>var x = 42.</code>
<br>
<br>
<code> let y = 13.</code>
<br>
<br>
<code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>
